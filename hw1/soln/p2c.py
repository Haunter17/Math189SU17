Start file for hw1pr2 part(a) of Big Data Summer 2017

The file is seperated into two parts:
	1) the helper functions
	2) the main driver.

The helper functions are all functions necessary to finish the problem.
The main driver will use the helper functions you finished to report and print
out the results you need for the problem.

First, please COMMENT OUT any steps other than step 0 in main driver before
you finish the corresponding functions for that step. Otherwise, you won't be
able to run the program because of errors.

After finishing the helper functions for each step, you can uncomment
the code in main driver to check the result.

Note:
1. Please read the instructions and hints carefully, and use the name of the
variables we provided, otherwise, the function may not work.

2. Remember to comment out the TODO comment after you finish each part.

		This function finds and returns the index of the k nearest neighbors
